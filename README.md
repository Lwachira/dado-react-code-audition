This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


### Running as a live instance on your machine 

```bash
npm rub build
npm run start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```

I decided to use Nextjs for the ease of deploying to vercel:
